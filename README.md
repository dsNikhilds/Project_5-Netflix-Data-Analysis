Dataset Exploration with Police data

Data source : Police Data : https://www.kaggle.com/pranabpandit/police-data

This data set includes information about the violators, type of violation, search condiucted etc.

Data structure: This csv file include 65535 rows and 15 coloumns.

In my opinion the following questions are the most important question in the data set.

1. Based on speeding, were men or women stopped more often?
2. Does gender affect who gets searched during a stop ?
3. What is the mean stop duration?
4. Compare the age distributions for each violation
